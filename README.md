# GroupMail Script
## Description
Script used to send grading emails to a group of students.
Wrote this script to ease my job of being a teaching assistant.
It works by parsing a csv file of grading report then send emails based on the UNI in the first column of the csv file.
## Example
score.xls is a example grade report excel.
The title row must start with "title" and the total score row must start with "credit".
Save the xls as a csv file with the Field Delimiter and Quote Char specified in the script (This is supported by most excel tools).
Help of the command:
```
age: groupmail.py file [options]

Options:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -s, --send        send email, if not set, just print e-mail content
  -n, --no-confirm  no ask for comfirmation of the content of each e-mail
                    before send
```
Run the script using the following command:
```
python groupmail.py <csvfilename> -s
```
Sample email output:
```
